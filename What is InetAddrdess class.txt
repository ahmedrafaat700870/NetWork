Java InetAddress class represents an IP address. The java.net.InetAddress class provides methods to get the IP of any host name for example www.javatpoint.com, www.google.com, www.facebook.com, etc.

An IP address is represented by 32-bit or 128-bit unsigned number. An instance of InetAddress represents the IP address with its corresponding host name. There are two types of addresses: Unicast and Multicast. The Unicast is an identifier for a single interface whereas Multicast is an identifier for a set of interfaces.

Moreover, InetAddress has a cache mechanism to store successful and unsuccessful host name resolutions.

Most networks combine IP with TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). It builds a virtual bridge among the destination and the source.
